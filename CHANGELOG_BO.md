# Bayesian Optimization Refactoring Changelog

## Overview

This refactoring adds a complete Bayesian Optimization (BO) interface to `supermarket.py` for automatic PID controller tuning. The existing simulation functionality is unchanged - all new features are additive.

## What's New

### Core BO Functions (in `supermarket.py`)

1. **`compute_reference_metrics()`** - Computes baseline metrics for normalization
2. **`detect_hard_violations()`** - Detects safety constraint violations
3. **`evaluate_bo_objective()`** - Main BO objective function (scalar loss)
4. **`run_bo_tuning()`** - Complete BO optimization loop using Ax

### New Scripts

1. **`tune_pid_with_bo.py`** - Standalone BO tuning script (requires `ax-platform`)
2. **`test_bo_interface.py`** - Test suite to validate BO functions (no Ax needed)
3. **`manual_pid_comparison.py`** - Manual PID parameter comparison tool

### Documentation

1. **`BO_TUNING_GUIDE.md`** - Comprehensive guide for BO usage
2. **`README.md`** - Updated with BO quick start section

## Key Features

### 1. Flexible Objective Function

The objective function combines three paper metrics with configurable weights:

```python
L(θ) = w_con·γ̃_con + w_sw·γ̃_switch + w_pow·γ̃_pow + λ·Φ(θ)
```

Where:
- **γ̃_con**: Normalized constraint violation (temperature + pressure)
- **γ̃_switch**: Normalized switching rate (compressors + valves)
- **γ̃_pow**: Normalized average power consumption
- **Φ(θ)**: Hard constraint violation penalty

Default weights: `w_con=1.0`, `w_pow=0.3`, `w_sw=0.2`, `λ=10.0`

### 2. Normalization

All metrics are normalized against a baseline reference run to ensure comparable scales:

```python
γ̃ = γ / γ_baseline
```

This makes the loss ~1.0 for baseline parameters and allows direct comparison.

### 3. Hard Constraint Penalties

Prevents BO from finding unsafe solutions:
- Temperature violations: T < 1.5°C or T > 5.5°C for >60s
- Pressure violations: P > 2.05 bar for >60s

Each sustained violation adds a penalty of λ (default: 10) to the loss.

### 4. Day/Night Blending

Metrics from day and night periods are blended:

```python
γ̃ = α·γ̃_day + (1-α)·γ̃_night
```

Default α=0.5 treats both periods equally.

### 5. Multi-Seed Support

For robustness under load noise:

```python
loss = evaluate_bo_objective(theta, seeds=(42, 43, 44))
```

Returns the mean loss across all seeds.

### 6. Search Space

Default parameter ranges:

| Parameter | Range | Scale | Description |
|-----------|-------|-------|-------------|
| Kp | [-150, -10] | Linear | Proportional gain |
| τ_I | [10, 200] s | **Log** | Integral time constant |
| DB | [0.05, 0.35] bar | Linear | Dead band |

The log scale for τ_I helps explore both fast and slow integral actions efficiently.

## Usage Examples

### Quick Evaluation

```python
from supermarket import evaluate_bo_objective, compute_reference_metrics

ref_metrics = compute_reference_metrics(scenario='2d-2c', seed=42)
theta = (-100.0, 75.0, 0.15)  # (Kp, tau_I, DB)
loss = evaluate_bo_objective(theta, scenario='2d-2c', ref_metrics=ref_metrics)
print(f"Loss: {loss:.3f}")
```

### Full BO Optimization

```python
from supermarket import run_bo_tuning

best_params, best_loss = run_bo_tuning(
    scenario='2d-2c',
    n_trials=50,      # Number of BO iterations
    n_seeds=1,        # Seeds per evaluation
    verbose=True
)

print(f"Optimal: Kp={best_params['Kp']:.2f}, "
      f"tau_I={best_params['tau_I']:.2f}, "
      f"DB={best_params['DB']:.3f}")
```

### Manual Comparison

```bash
python manual_pid_comparison.py
```

## Installation

The refactored code has no new dependencies for basic usage. For full BO:

```bash
pip install ax-platform
```

## Testing

Validate the BO interface without Ax:

```bash
python test_bo_interface.py
```

This runs 5 tests covering:
1. Reference metric computation
2. Hard violation detection
3. Objective function evaluation
4. Parameter clipping
5. Multi-seed evaluation

## Backward Compatibility

✅ **100% backward compatible**

All existing functionality is preserved:
- Original `run_scenario()` works unchanged
- All plotting and metrics functions unchanged
- Main execution block runs the same baseline simulations

The BO interface is completely additive.

## Performance Notes

### Typical Runtimes (on M1 MacBook)

- Single simulation: ~5 seconds (14400s sim, dt=1s)
- BO with 50 trials: ~4-5 minutes
- BO with 100 trials + 3 seeds: ~25-30 minutes

### Speedup Tips

1. **Reduce trials for exploration**: Start with 20-30 trials
2. **Single seed initially**: Use `n_seeds=1` for faster iteration
3. **Multi-fidelity (advanced)**: Use shorter simulations in early trials

## Design Decisions

### Why These Weights?

Default weights (`w_con=1.0`, `w_pow=0.3`, `w_sw=0.2`) prioritize:
1. **Safety/comfort** (γ_con) most important
2. **Power** (γ_pow) moderately important
3. **Switching** (γ_switch) less important (covered by metrics)

Adjust based on your priorities.

### Why Normalize?

Without normalization:
- γ_con ~ 2 [°C²]
- γ_switch ~ 0.001 [s⁻¹]
- γ_pow ~ 13000 [W]

Direct weighting would be dominated by power. Normalization makes all metrics ~1.0.

### Why Hard Penalties?

BO is goal-driven and may exploit soft bounds. Hard penalties create a safety buffer:
- Soft bounds: [2, 5]°C for temperature
- Hard bounds: [1.5, 5.5]°C with large penalty
- This prevents BO from finding technically valid but uncomfortable solutions

### Why Log Scale for τ_I?

Integral time constants often span orders of magnitude:
- Fast: 10-30s (responsive but may overshoot)
- Medium: 40-100s (balanced)
- Slow: 150-200s (smooth but sluggish)

Log scale explores this range efficiently.

## Future Extensions

Possible enhancements (not implemented):

1. **Multi-fidelity BO**: Fast early exploration with coarse simulations
2. **Pareto optimization**: Find trade-off frontier for (γ_con, γ_pow, γ_switch)
3. **Contextual BO**: Optimize for specific operating conditions
4. **Transfer learning**: Use results from 2d-2c to warm-start 3d-3c
5. **Additional parameters**: Tune T_air bounds, sample times, etc.
